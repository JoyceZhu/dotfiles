Stayed in some motel and got up early. The weather was decent but the black flies were utter torture, especially in the Alpine Garden. At this point I realized the people with the ridiculous bug hats were really onto something. We swung by Mt. Monroe next.","16687"

Turns out he was acclimated to the high final elevation from previous climbing and I...wasn't. Got pretty altitude sick and was spinning in circles for a bit but eventually made it. On the way down the rocky talus heard a woman tearfully complaining about how poorly maintained the trail was because of the 'too many rocks'.","56576"

"'2019-10-13","Suc","Half Dome","8840","2694","","USA-CA","1363","415","A rough hike with Brett and Zimu (replacing Gaspar who was getting 'tested' by his gf, replacing Cronin dropping out) but we ultimately finished in just under 10 hours 30 minutes anyway, which was very respectable!<br><br>Good thing I wrote a packing checklist so Zimu spontaneously bought trekking poles. We drove over from the Bay Area the night before and saw Shaun with his wife (did not plan it but we ascended the same day), staying in a cabin.<br><br>Woke at 4 to leave camp. Incredibly beautiful stars as we began the hike; Brett grew concerned about Zimu's pace but was reassured after we easily caught up to/ran into Shaun and his wife. Really moving sunrise, trail still quiet at this time. A steep but doable ascent into a bit of a reprieve -- woods trail. The sub dome was some rough hiking at high elevation; I'm glad we thought to bring gloves and harnesses for the cables given the slickness of the underlying well-used rock. Ran into someone from Sudbury when encountering cables traffic on the way down. Filtered some water from the river, a real lifesaver since that stuff is heavy. Obnoxious amount of tourist traffic by the time we managed to return to the lower falls area, but overall a spectacular experience. Even got home by that night","56936"

The path became quite steep at times which was exhausting, and had to backtrack a couple times due to insufficient markings. Some minor scrambling to get to the summit here, which ironically offered me the best views of all the trip (and some cell signal! and solitude!) so happy to have been here.","100677"

There was one nice view of the Mt. Washington hotel. Annoying shirtless dude sitting on the summit cairn managed to block my view of the Willey Range Trail so I incorrectly descended it the wrong way once trying to figure out how to continue. It was pretty fun to see one woman in the exact same shirt as me on top though (their group had someone for whom this was their first 4000-footer).","100577"

Field so no fun ladders).<br><br>I regretted taking this extension until I got an inexplicable burst of energy in the afternoon; summit was full of flying ants and wooded, and the trail was extremely narrow (tore a running jacket pocket on a branch!) and beyond muddy. Really relying on my hiking pole and some agility to get through.","100585"

A gray and misty day so unfortunately we weren't able to see the view from the summit, but it was a good hike to get him into hiking in the Whites and we were at least able to enjoy the tail end of foliage and have a good chat next to a babbling brook. The summit was quite cold and featured some ice and snow already -- some 'ice fries' (small rectangles of ice) were coming down on us, maybe from a cloud? Wild","100571"

Saw several nice dogs. Incredibly beautiful Memorial Day weekend weather, lots of sun. Permethrin seriously impressed me, not a single bite.","100594"
